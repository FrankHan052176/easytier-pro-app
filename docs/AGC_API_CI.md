# AGC API CI

The `ohos` workflow uploads the signed `publish/release` App and submits an AGC test version through the AppGallery Connect API Client flow.

Configure these repository Secrets:

- `AGC_CLIENT_ID`
- `AGC_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AGC_APP_ID`

The API Client must be a team-level client (`N/A` project) with permission to upload packages and manage testing versions. The default China endpoint is `connect-api.cloud.huawei.com`; override it with the repository variable `AGC_API_DOMAIN` only when the AGC data-processing region requires another endpoint.

Optional repository variables:

- `AGC_API_DOMAIN`: defaults to `connect-api.cloud.huawei.com`.
- `AGC_TEST_DURATION_DAYS`: invitation-test lifetime in days; defaults to `14`.

The workflow only creates HarmonyOS invitation testing versions: `testType=3` and `onshelfSelfDetect=0`. It obtains a token, requests a short-lived upload URL, and uploads the `.app` once. The resulting `objectId` is always registered twice through the package API: `distributeMode=1` for invitation testing and `distributeMode=2` for AppGallery listing. Both packages must compile; only the mode-1 package ID is bound to the invitation test version. It then queries every invitation-test group through the paginated `/api/app-test/v1/test-group/list` API. `appId` is sent as a request header for that API.

The update request refuses to proceed without at least one group. It writes every `groupId`, a start time one hour after the current UTC time, an end time after `AGC_TEST_DURATION_DAYS`, `displayArea="1"`, and `needShareLink=0`. The Pro workflow sets `AGC_NOTIFY_ON_PUSH=0`, so dispatches, manual runs, pushes, and retries never notify testers.

The test description is deliberately constrained to 30 characters (stricter than the API maximum): `同步上游 <HAR version>` for a Core dispatch, the push commit message for a push, and the current SHA for a manual run. The same text is sent in both the version-creation request and `openTestInfo.testDesc`, which is the test description configurable in AppGallery Connect. GitHub artifacts keep their full provenance name; if that name exceeds the AGC 64-byte package-file limit, the uploaded package uses `EasyTierPro-<Core version>.app` (or a hash fallback) while retaining the same signed App content. The script does not print the Client Secret or access token. When the three required Secrets are absent, the AGC step is skipped and the signed GitHub artifact is still produced.
